<meta name="title" content="Lima: Where the pallbearers are black" />
<meta name="description" content="The pallbearers are in the job precisely because of the color of their skin, a phenomenon unique to this South American capital that was the regional seat of Spain's colonial empire for more than three centuries.  [...] prominent citizens such as Reyna, a widely respected, charitable man of indigenous origin who died at age 82, request black pallbearers for their funerals.  &quot;Beyond the question of racism or prejudice, I think it is simply a question of employment,&quot; said Jose Campos, a leading Peruvian black studies scholar and vice rector of the National Education University.  Blacks are all but absent from Peru's business and political elite and although slavery was abolished in 1854, only 2 percent of Peru's blacks go to college.  Tanya Hernandez, a professor at Fordham University in the U.S. and author of the book &quot;Racial Subordination in Latin America,&quot; said the tradition also reflects &quot;problems in the entire region with descendants of Africans who have no space in public life or ways of advancing in the economy or politically.&quot;  Adam Warren, a University of Washington professor who has studied Lima's funeral culture, said that in colonial days the tradition was considered both an expression of status and an act of reverence for the dead.  Christ is the only one who doesn't discriminate,&quot; he said as he walked home from work through the mean streets of Malambito, a Lima district rife with drug abusers who smoke partially processed cocaine known as &quot;base.  &quot;There was nothing left for me than to be a casket carrier,&quot; said Rivas, a white-haired single man who lives with his mother and bets on horses, as he dined on a cheap lunch in his neighborhood.  In 2009 the government of then-President Alan Garcia issued a public apology to Afro-Peruvians for a racist tradition of colonial slavery but still they never received reparations." />
